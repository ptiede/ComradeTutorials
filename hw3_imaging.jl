md"""
In this tutorial, we will create a preliminary reconstruction of the 2017 M87 data on April 6
by simultaneously creating an image and model for the instrument. By instrument model, we
mean something akin to self-calibration in traditional VLBI imaging terminology. However,
unlike traditional self-cal, we will solve for the gains each time we update the image
self-consistently. This allows us to model the correlations between gains and the image.

## Building the Model/Posterior

md"""
For our model, we will be using an image model that consists of a raster of point sources, convolved with some pulse or kernel to make a ContinuousImage. To define this model we define the standard two argument function sky that defines the sky model we want to fit. The first argument are the model parameters, and are typically a NamedTuple. The second argument defines the metadata for the model that is typically constant. For our model, the constant metdata will just by the mean or prior image.

However, we need to ensure our raster has a positive flux density for each pixel.
Additionally, since image total flux is degenerate with gains we also want to make sure the image is normalized to some fiducial value `ftot` that we will take as given apriori. To satisfy both of these constraints, we will transform our pixel parameters `c` using the softmax function or the inverse of the centered log-ratio transform. 

In this setting, the parameters `c` can then be viewed as stochastic fluctuations on top of the mean image `mimg`. For simplicity, `Comrade` provides the convienence function `apply_fluctuations` for this transform.

Now, let's set up our image model. The EHT's nominal resolution is 20-25 μas. Additionally,
the EHT is not very sensitive to a larger field of view. Typically 60-80 μas is enough to
describe the compact flux of M87. Given this, we only need to use a small number of pixels
to describe our image.

Now we need to specify our image prior. For this work we will use a Gaussian Markov
Random field prior
Since we are using a Gaussian Markov random field prior we need to first specify our `mean`
image. This behaves somewhat similary to a entropy regularizer in that it will
start with an initial guess for the image structure. For this tutorial we will use a
a symmetric Gaussian with a FWHM of 50 μas

Now we can form our metadata we need to fully define our model.

Now we specify the instrument priors. The gains will be broken into two components
  - Gain amplitudes which are typically known to 10-20%, except for LMT, which has amplitudes closer to 50-100%.
  - Gain phases which are more difficult to constrain and can shift rapidly.

To specify the gains for each site we use the `IIDSitePrior` and `ArrayPrior` composite types. `IIDSitePrior` specifies the prior for a single site and means
that for each time segment, the gain is independent. For the EHT, since the data
is apriori calibrated we use the `ScanSeg` time segmentation, which means that the gain is independent for each *scan*, the other options are:
 - `IntegSeg`: every integration time has an independent intrument parameter
 - `TrackSeg`: The instrument parameter is constant over the whole track.

These look reasonable, although there may be some minor overfitting. This is actually a generic feature of a MAP estimate for these models.
